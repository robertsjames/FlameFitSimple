# AC_backgrounds_pdfs

## Structure

A lookup table called 'nestyields.txt' is required to run the software. This file does not
need to be re-recreated, but if it does need to be updated, use 'FetchNESTData'.

ACClasses.py contains class and some function definitions.

ACTemplateMaker is the python notebook to run to actually generate a background PDF.
